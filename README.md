# btcr-DID-method

To support the development of our DID method, we created two
command-line applications. The first application, `txid2txref`, can
convert Bitcoin transaction ids, or
[txids](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/txid), to
[txrefs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0136.mediawiki),
and vice-versa. It uses bitcoind to verify the transactions. The second
application, `createBtcrDid`, will create a [decentralized identifier
(DID)](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/) on the Bitcoin
blockchain. It also uses bitcoind to submit the transaction needed to
create the DID.

## Building txid2txref and createBtcrDid

This README assumes that you have bitcoind running somewhere, locally or
remotely. bitcoind needs to be a full node and needs to have a full
transaction database (launched with -txindex or with txindex=1 in
bitcoin.conf) and needs to have RPC turned on (launched with -server or
server=1 in bitcoin.conf).

We have developed and tested `txid2txref` and `createBtcrDid` on Debian,
Ubuntu and MacOS systems. Each OS has it differences, so please check
the instructions below:

### Debian / Ubuntu

The following instructions should work with any of Debian 8, 9, 10, or
11 and Ubuntu 16, 18 and 20. Intermediate and subsequent versions will
probably work as well, but if you have any problems please let us know.

#### Install Prerequisites

You will need to have a basic C++ development setup and several dependent packages:
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install make cmake gcc g++ git unzip libcurl4-openssl-dev libjsoncpp-dev uuid-dev libjsonrpccpp-dev libjsonrpccpp-tools libboost-dev
```

#### Build and install libbitcoin-api-cpp

Clone [libbitcoin-api-cpp from Github](https://github.com/minium/bitcoin-api-cpp/).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/minium/bitcoin-api-cpp.git
```

This is a cmake-based project, so the standard process can be done here:

```
cd bitcoin-api-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

#### Build txid2txref and createBtcrDid

If you don't already have it, clone [btcr-DID-method from
Github](https://github.com/dcdpr/btcr-DID-method/). There are git
submodules in the project, so we need to be sure to init and update them correctly:

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dcdpr/btcr-DID-method.git
```

This is a cmake-based project, so the standard process can be done here:

```
cd btcr-DID-method
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### MacOS

The following instructions should work with any of MacOS 10.13: "High
Sierra", 10.14: "Mojave" and 10.15: "Catalina". Subsequent versions will
probably work as well, but if you have any problems please let us know.

#### Install Prerequisites

You will want to install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you haven't already. See their installation instructions, or try:
```
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
``` 

Next, you will need to get some packages:
```
$ brew update
$ brew install jsoncpp libjson-rpc-cpp boost
```

#### Build and install bitcoin-api-cpp

homebrew installs jsoncpp (from above step) a little differently than bitcoin-api-cpp expects. Until the bitcoin-api-cpp folks update their project, 
you should clone our local copy of [bitcoin-api-cpp from Github](https://github.com/danpape/bitcoin-api-cpp/).

```
$ git clone https://github.com/danpape/bitcoin-api-cpp.git
```

This is a cmake-based project, so the standard process can be done here:

```
cd bitcoin-api-cpp
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```

#### Build txid2txref and createBtcrDid

If you don't already have it, clone [btcr-DID-method from Github](https://github.com/dcdpr/btcr-DID-method/).
There are git submodules in the project, so we need to be sure to init
and update them correctly:
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/dcdpr/btcr-DID-method.git
```

This is a cmake-based project, so the standard process can be done here:

```
cd btcr-DID-method
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

# Running txid2txref

The `txid2txref` application is based on the [txid2bech32
app](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/btcr-hackathon) created during
the 2017 BTCR Virtual Hackathon.

`txid2txref` is run as `txid2txref [txid]` and when given a valid `txid`,
will output a `txref` along with some other info. `txid2txref` will
communicate with an instance of bitcoind via RPC to retrieve information
about that transaction so it can create the `txref`. `txid2txref` can also
be run as `txid2txref [txref]` and will output info about the bitcoin
transaction referred to.

You can ask `txid2txref` for help and it will show all the runtime options
available:

```
$ ./src/txid2txref --help
Usage: txid2txref [options] <txid|txref>

 -h  --help                 Print this help
 --rpcconnect [host or IP]  RPC host (default: 127.0.0.1)
 --rpcuser [user]           RPC user
 --rpcpassword [pass]       RPC password
 --rpcport [port]           RPC port (default: try both 8332 and 18332)
 --config [config_path]     Full pathname to bitcoin.conf (default: <homedir>/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)
 --txoIndex [index #]       Index # for TXO within the transaction (default: 0)

<txid|txref>                input: can be a txid to encode, or a txref to decode
```

Many of the runtime options for `txid2txref` are for connecting to
bitcoind over RPC. There are four `--rpc*` options that you can use for
connecting to a local or remote bitcoind:

```
$ ./src/txid2txref --rpcuser bitcoinrpc --rpcpassword super-secret-passwd --rpcconnect 127.0.0.1 --rpcport 18332 <txid>
{...}
```

If you have bitcoind running locally, you probably have a bitcoin.conf
file with all the RPC info in there. If so, you can use it instead of
setting all of the `--rpc*` options:

```
$ # by default it will look in <homedir>/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
$ ./src/txid2txref <txid>
{...}

$ # or you can use a different location
$ ./src/txid2txref --config /tmp/bitcoin.conf <txid>
{...}
```

When given a txid, `txid2txref` will connect to bitcoind to verify it is a
valid txid and, if found, gather some info about it. Then it will output
some JSON with details about that transaction, and the txref.

```
$ ./src/txid2txref f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7521234
Error: transaction f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7521234 not found.

$ ./src/txid2txref f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7528107
{
    "txid": "f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7528107",
    "txref": "txtest1:xyv2-xzpq-q63z-7p4",
    "did": "did:btcr:xyv2-xzpq-q63z-7p4",
    "network": "test",
    "block-height": "1152194",
    "transaction-index": "1",
    "txo-index": "0",
    "query-string": "f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7528107"
}
```

`txid2txref` can also output an extended txref if the --txoIndex flag is given.

```
$ ./src/txid2txref f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7528107 | jq '{txref}'
{
  "txref": "txtest1:xyv2-xzpq-q63z-7p4"
}

$ ./src/txid2txref --txoIndex 1 f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7528107 | jq '{txref}'
{
  "txref": "txtest1:8yv2-xzpq-qpqq-cew3-4s"
}
```

Alternately, instead of a txid, `txid2txref` can be given a txref to
decode and look up the transaction info in bitcoind:

```
$ ./src/txid2txref txtest1:8yv2-xzpq-qpqq-cew3-4s
{
    "txid": "f8cdaff3ebd9e862ed5885f8975489090595abe1470397f79780ead1c7528107",
    "txref": "txtest1:8yv2-xzpq-qpqq-cew3-4s",
    "did": "did:btcr:8yv2-xzpq-qpqq-cew3-4s",
    "network": "test",
    "block-height": "1152194",
    "transaction-index": "1",
    "txo-index": "1",
    "query-string": "txtest1:8yv2-xzpq-qpqq-cew3-4s"
}
```


# Running createBtcrDid

You can ask `createBtcrDid` for help, and it will show all the runtime
options available:

```
> ./src/createBtcrDid --help
Usage: createBtcrDid [options] <inputXXX> <outputAddress> <private key> <fee> <ddoRef>

 -h  --help                 Print this help
 --rpcconnect [host or IP]  RPC host (default: 127.0.0.1)
 --rpcuser [user]           RPC user
 --rpcpassword [pass]       RPC password
 --rpcport [port]           RPC port (default: try both 8332 and 18332)
 --config [config_path]     Full pathname to bitcoin.conf (default: <homedir>/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf)
 --txoIndex [index]         Index # of which TXO to use from the input transaction (default: 0)
 -n --dryrun                Do everything except submit transaction to blockchain

<inputXXX>      input: (bitcoin address, txid, txref) needs at least slightly more unspent BTCs than your offered fee
<outputAddress> output bitcoin address: will receive transaction change and be the basis for your DID
<private key>   private key in base58 (wallet import format)
<fee>           fee you are willing to pay (suggestion: >0.001 BTC)
<ddoRef>        reference to a DDO you want as part of your DID (optional)
```

Many of the runtime options for `createBtcrDid` are for connecting to
bitcoind over RPC. There are four `--rpc*` options that you can use for
connecting to a local or remote bitcoind:

```
$ ./src/createBtcrDid --rpcuser bitcoinrpc --rpcpassword super-secret-passwd --rpcconnect 127.0.0.1 --rpcport 18332 ...
```

If you have bitcoind running locally, you probably have a bitcoin.conf
file with all the RPC info in there. If so, you can use it instead of
setting all of the `--rpc*` options:

```
$ # by default it will look in <homedir>/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
$ ./src/createBtcrDid ...
{...}

$ # or you can use a different location
$ ./src/createBtcrDid --config /tmp/bitcoin.conf ...
{...}
```

`createBtcrDid` has many required positional parameters:

#### inputXXX
This is the input transaction--where you need to have at least slightly
more unspent BTCs than your offered fee (see below). You can refer to
this transaction in many ways: a Bitcoin address (with optional
txoIndex, given with `--txoIndex` parameter); a txid (with optional
txoIndex); a txref (with optional txoIndex).

#### outputAddress
This is the output Bitcoin address. It will receive transaction change and be the basis for your DID.

#### private key
private key in base58 (wallet import format)

#### fee
fee you are willing to pay (suggestion: >0.001 BTC)

#### ddoRef
reference to a DDO you want as part of your DID. Usually a URL to a
JSON-LD document. (optional)

## Example of how to use createBtcrDid

Some prerequisites:
- you need a running instance of bitcoind, with the option "txindex=1"
enabled so you have full transaction history.
- you need to have some BTC, either on the mainnet, testnet, or
restest blockchain (whatever your bitcoind is running)
- you need the txid of a transaction with your BTC, and the index of the
TXO you want to use (if it is other than 0)
- if you want your DID to have a reference to an external document with
more info (a DDO) then make sure you have a URL for where it can be
retrieved from.

Make sure you know the txid and how much you have to spend from it. You can use
bitcoin-cli to check:

```
$ bitcoin-cli listunspent | jq -r '.[] | { txid: .txid, address: .address, vout: .vout, amount: .amount }'
{
  "txid": "79d864cc59b0c3ac240fc78e5a79edb13182b88c9ed1c60526eda6657a5d5e9e",
  "address": "mvwGweRzRDwydpJfW1uqWJN4iZvNBZ9zZ4",
  "vout": 0,
  "amount": 0.02
}
```

If you want to start using txrefs right away, you can use `txid2txref` to
convert your txid:

```
$ ./src/txid2txref --txoIndex 0 79d864cc59b0c3ac240fc78e5a79edb13182b88c9ed1c60526eda6657a5d5e9e | jq '{txref}'
{
  "txref": "txtest1:xvn9-0z8q-qn3s-nf7"
}
```

You need to decide how much you want to spend to create your DID--this
is the transaction fee. You probably want this as low as possible. For
the testnet, you can probably get by with a fee of 0.0005 BTC.

You need a new address for your transaction change to go to. This
will also be the basis for your DID. You can make one with bitcoin-cli:

```
$ bitcoin-cli getrawchangeaddress
myxJdFGMAnX4SiBg2hTKsZRr8ReE5irjS5
```

Finally, you need the private key for the address of your original
transaction. You can get it from bitcoin-cli:

```
$ bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey mvwGweRzRDwydpJfW1uqWJN4iZvNBZ9zZ4
randomrandomrandomrandomrandomrandomrandomrandomrand
```

Putting this all together, now you are ready to run `createBtcrDid`:

```
$ ./src/createBtcrDid \
79d864cc59b0c3ac240fc78e5a79edb13182b88c9ed1c60526eda6657a5d5e9e \
myxJdFGMAnX4SiBg2hTKsZRr8ReE5irjS5 \
randomrandomrandomrandomrandomrandomrandomrandomrand \
0.0005 \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danpape/self/master/ddo-ext.jsonld

Transaction submitted. Result txid: cd94e5a4a1aa1b19988faed93d31d50195b75390130304358369a63e8caec5ef

```

Using a block explorer, you can check that it looks good. For instance,
you can look up this example transaction on
[blockcypher.com](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/tx/cd94e5a4a1aa1b19988faed93d31d50195b75390130304358369a63e8caec5ef/)
and can see that 0.0005 BTC was spent, from
`mvwGweRzRDwydpJfW1uqWJN4iZvNBZ9zZ4` to
`myxJdFGMAnX4SiBg2hTKsZRr8ReE5irjS5`. There is also an extra TXO there,
with 0.0 BTC which contains the DDO linked from github.

Finally, you can again use `txid2txref` to get your DID:
```
$ ./src/txid2txref --txoIndex 1 cd94e5a4a1aa1b19988faed93d31d50195b75390130304358369a63e8caec5ef | jq '{did}'
{
  "did": "did:btcr:8km9-0zyz-qpqq-sutc-5x"
}
```

## Note: bech32bis update
In Decemeber, 2019, Pieter Wuille did [research](https://gist.github.com/sipa/a9845b37c1b298a7301c33a04090b2eb) into the error detecting 
properties of the bech32 encoding alorithm. Based on a problem and fix he found, an internal constant in the algorithm has been updated from `1` to `0x3FFFFFFF`. This 
has the effect of changing the checksum values embedded in the txrefs and DIDs output by our programs.

More info can be found [here](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2019-December/017521.html).

If you find that a DID is reported as invalid by BTCR, you may be using an old one with a (now) invalid checksum. In that case, you should update the txref part of your DID with the `txid2tref` program.  There are no known outdated implementations.
